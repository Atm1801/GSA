# MIA-Gradient-based-Attack

The `gen_l2_gradients.py` script shows how to calculate the L2 norm of gradients.

The `preprocess_datasets.py` script prepares the dataset for training.

If you want to use the CIFAR-10 dataset, run `prepare_cifar.py` before running preprocess_datasets.py.

## Running locally with PyTorch
